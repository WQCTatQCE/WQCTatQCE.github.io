### Consumers and end-users of quantum computing/sensing/communication
Panel Leaders: Sreeraman Rajan, Yuichi Nakamura, and Jingbo Wang

The panel will address the perspectives and implications for consumers and end-users of quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies. As quantum technologies transition from research labs to real-world applications, understanding their impact on consumer everyday life and industry becomes crucial. Experts will discuss the potential benefits and challenges faced by end-users, including privacy concerns, data security, and the accessibility of quantum technologies. The discussion will also cover how these advancements could transform sectors such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications. The discussion will bring together stakeholders from Industry (big enterprises like communication companies, health care, and startups), Government (research labs and policy), Granting agencies (NSERC, DND, Mitacs) and Academia). Attendees will gain insights into how they can prepare for the widespread adoption of quantum technologies and what it means for consumer behavior and future technological landscapes.
