The Workshop on Quantum in Consumer Technology is the third of its series at IEEE Quantum Week. Year after year, the Quantum Computing industry continues to develop toward a future in which it will play a major role in day-to-day consumer life. The Workshop on Quantum in Consumer Technology will discuss Quantum Technologies’ status, innovations, and future directions, with an interest in the interdisciplinary technologies, applications, manufacturing, and standards for consumer products, services, systems, and architectures.


<!-- The workshop is made of three sessions:
- Session 1 - Post-QuantumCryptography
- Session 2 - Consumers and end-users of quantum computing/sensing/communication
- Session 3 - Invited Talk session -->
<!-- Paper session on "Quantum sensors and quantum computing applications in IoT and Smart Cities" -->
