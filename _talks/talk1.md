Despite its prominence in classical computing, reproducibility remains a challenge in current QC research. The variability in error rates for individual qubits occurs on a time scale as short as seconds and minutes, complicating the reporting of computational outcomes. This variability poses significant hurdles to both replicating experiments and ensuring robustness in results. There is a pressing need for a deeper understanding of this variability to develop strategies across the entire QC stack to mitigate factors that undermine reproducibility. While there is a gradual move towards standardization of quantum technologies, more direct approaches are warranted.

This workshop session aims to explore strategies to enhance reproducibility in this domain by addressing several key areas:
- Efficient data structures and scalable storage solutions to capture and preserve the details of quantum computations.
- Establishment of standardized data formats and open-source repositories to facilitate data sharing and collaboration within the QC community.
- Development of standardized benchmarks and automated
validation testing methodologies to assess the performance and correctness of quantum computations.
